When asked many developers would say that you should own your dependencies when working in a language such as Python or Ruby. I disagree and agree. I think the solution though is not to write your own, but something entirely different. 

I believe that instead of taking the wasting time of writing your own dependencies, the time could be better spent developing meaningful software. That being said, I don't think that dependencies should be ignored. Quite the contrary, I think that when dependencies are upgraded a code review and test should be done to ensure that they do not break your precious app.

So I leave you with this, own those dependencies before you update. Don't waste time.
